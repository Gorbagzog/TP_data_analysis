    "The study of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is complicated by the fact that we are within it.\n",
    "The sun, located at 8.5 kpc from the galactic center, moves in a circular orbit with a radial velocity of\n",
    "220 km.s$^{-1}$.\n",
    "As a first approximation, we can discribe the galactic plane as a sum of three components : Gas (molecular and neutral hydrogen), Star\n",
    "and Dark Matter. Around this galactic plane, in what is called the galactic halo, there is an important gas reservoir mainly composed of neutral gas (HI).\n",
    "It turns out that this reservoir could be an important source of gas for the formation of molecular clouds, the place where stars are formed.\n",
    "To better understand the content and nature of this reservoir, we propose in this work to study one of these clouds, called High Velocity Clouds (HVC).\n",
